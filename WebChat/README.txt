This is my WebChat. When you enter, you find a log in section. To log in, is mandatory to input a username and pick a profile picture by clicking on 
the desired on. You can also input the roomname you want to join, but by default it enters to JarJarBinks_ClubDeFans. 

Once you logged in, you can start chatting with the people in the room. When you enter, you will receive a log with the previous messages that were
sent before you joined. You can not send a empty message. When a message is sent, it is also shown the username and profile picture next to it.

The last message is shown in the room history, the section on the left of the chat. 

There are several things I wanted to implement, but I did not have time, such as:

	- The system message when someone joins does not show the ID but the username.
	- Sending private messages.
	- Joining more rooms when in the chat, showing them in the room history, together with the photo of the room and the last message.
	- Being able to change username and profile picture without restarting the web chat.
